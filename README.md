# C.A.V.A control for LEDs
Control LEDs (or any other light source) intensity trough C.A.V.A raw output and Arduino.
# C.A.V.A use
This project uses raw data provided by C.A.V.A (Console-based Audio Visualizer for ALSA). Follow the documentation in the C.A.V.A project [GitHub page](https://github.com/karlstav/cava) to understand and install it.

### Set up
You should modify the C.A.V.A [config](https://github.com/karlstav/cava/blob/master/example_files/config) file to your liking, making sure to set the following parameters:
```
data_format = ascii
bit_format = 8bit
method = raw
```
### How to use
To run the program that sends raw data from C.A.V.A trough the serial port, you should run the following command:
```
cava | cava-raw-output
```
### Arduino
The code in `led-controller.ino` should be loaded in your Arduino. It takes 4-bit brightness data input from the serial port and uses it to set the light intensity trough the analog output pins.
